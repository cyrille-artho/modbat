Version	Description

1.0.0	Initial release. Built against Scala 2.9.2.

1.0.1	Fixed bug about reporting on classes with empty package names.

1.0.2	Fixed typo in example/improvements in documentation.

-- 1.2 series --

1.2.0	Internally used version. Features off-line code generation.
	Built against Scala 2.10.0.

1.2.1	Fixed typo in example/improvements in documentation.

-- 1.3 series --

1.3.0	Added optional label for actions.
	Better error handling for invalid model classes.
	Generating meaningful labels automatically for dot output when
	no user-defined label is given.
	Fixed bug where some transitions would not be shown in dot output.

-- 1.4 series --

1.4.0	Added optional weight for transitions.
	Changed behavior of random seed option (-s) for small numbers
	to avoid poor distributions in random values.
	Fixed bug where some transitions would be shown twice in dot output.
	Fixed bug in state coverage count in case launch was used.
	Defined and implemented more precise semantics for @Before/@After
	  when child instances are launched.
	Fixed bug where IllegalArgumentException was misclassified as a
	  failed requirement.

1.4.1	Added "chooseIf", which takes a list of predicates and actions,
	and chooses one of the actions of which the predicate is true
	(or none if no predicate is true).
	Fixed bug where coverage information was not always correct.

-- 1.5 series --

1.5.0	Added "@States" annotation, which allows the specification of
	self-loop transitions for multiple given states, by annotating
	a method.
	A failed transition action is now reported by its stack trace
	information rather than by reflection, which pinpoints the
	right source line of the failing last transition.

1.5.1	Minor bug fixes.

1.5.2	Various bug fixes regarding the output of "@States" transitions.

-- 2.0 series --

2.0.0	Annotations are now in upper case (thus models using annotations
	are not compatible between 1.X and 2.X).
	Added support for "@Throws", "@Weight" annotations for methods
	using "@States".
	Added support for showing coverage information of all launched
	(child) models, too, both as summary and as dot output.
	REMOVED option dot-file as it does not work for multiple outputs.
	Added option dot-dir to set output directory for dot files.
	Added API functions getRandomSeed, testFailed.

2.1.0	Initial support for Observer state machines.
	Added option --show-choices, which shows choices taken inside
	a transition (in the error trace).
	Rewrote code that handles requirements/assertions for:
	- more fine-grained control of model/SUT-level requirements, and
	- ability to handle assertion failures in other threads.

2.2.0	More UML-like visualization of state graph.

-- 3.0 series --

3.0	Simplified model syntax; less boilerplate code and no commas
	between transitions needed.
	REMOVED empty transitions (use "skip") and singleton models.
	- Remove "def instance = new MBT" from old models.
	- Change "Set[State]" to "List[State]" to ensure correct ordering.
	- To convert singleton models, keep annotated Init/Shutdown and
	  related code in companion object but move model to dynamic
	  instance (class).

3.1	Added a classification of test failures based on the exact
	exception and the transition in which they occurred.
	Added a feature to trace model variables using annotation @Trace.

3.2	- After a declared exception is caught, the next transition is
	  executed on the same model, so the successive action appears
	  to execute atomically with the action that caught the exception..
	  This helps with dealing with exceptions in models that have
	  multiple active instance. A non-atomic catch can be modeled
	  by inserting an additional "skip" transition.
	- Coverage now shows the percentage of all times a given edge
	  was taken (for non-zero coverage).
	- Print a warning if test has to be aborted because all
	  preconditions of all available transitions are false.
	- Added "join(Model)", which blocks the given model until the
	  target model has terminated. Note that termination does not
	  recognize transitions with impossible preconditions, but
	  only models with no outgoing transitions or where the loop
	  limit is reached.

3.3	- Build is now on gradle; the documentation has been updated
	  accordingly.
	- A system test suite with the test script bin/test.sh has been
	  added.
3.4 - The tool now supports the visualization of execution paths and 
      test case generation based on heuristic search.
